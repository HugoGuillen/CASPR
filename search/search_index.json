In order to use it, first you need to download the repository: git clone https://github.com/judithbergada/CASPRg.git At this point, the tool should be available in your computer. Conda Environment Installation CASPR employs several software packages to carry out its different functions: fastqc cutadapt fastx-toolkit STAR samtools mageck and mageck-vispr vispr R The easiest way to obtain them is to use Miniconda , which allows to create an isolated environment. To install miniconda, please follow the instuctions considering the operative system and architecture of your computer. Once Miniconda is installed, you can download all the packages from a single command like this: conda env create -n casprg -f environment.yml This will install the software defined in the environement.yml file, ensuring that the pipeline will run smoothly.
