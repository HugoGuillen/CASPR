## Download the Code and Data

Run once:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/judithbergada/CASPRg.git $HOME/CASPR
# Add CASPR to PATH = Installation
echo "export PATH=$HOME/CASPR/source:$PATH" >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
# Note the previous commands do not work if you use Zsh
```

Let's check that CASPR is available:

```bash
CASPR --help
```

## Let's enjoy CASPR

Go where the data is located.

```bash
ls -al $HOME/CASPR/testdata
```
